# Neighborhood United - A Django Restaurant Application

Neighborhood United is a community-centered application designed to connect local, certified chefs with the people they aim to serve in their respective communities. This application seeks to encourage local food sustainability, promote healthier dietary choices, and foster a sense of unity and connection through the power of shared meals.

## About

In the spirit of communal dining and shared culinary experiences, Neighborhood United was developed. The application is designed to bridge the gap between talented local chefs with access to commercial kitchens and the community members they wish to serve. By fostering these connections, we aim to encourage local entrepreneurship, uplift communities through access to diverse, nutritious meals, and enhance cultural exchange and understanding.

By equipping certified local chefs with a platform to showcase and share their culinary skills, we hope to cultivate a culture of togetherness and communal support. Each meal prepared and served holds the potential to nourish, inspire, and unite. With Neighborhood United, every dining table can become a vibrant meeting point of cultures, tastes, and stories.

Join us in our mission to unite neighborhoods one meal at a time.

## Usage

Neighborhood United is user-friendly and easy to navigate for all stakeholders involved, be it administrators, chefs, or customers.

### For Administrators:

As a community leader, you are responsible for managing the approval process for local chefs. Start by creating an admin account by running `python manage.py createsuperuser [username]`.

You can then oversee the verification of chefs' credentials and licenses to ensure they are qualified and legally authorized to serve food in the community. 

### For Chefs:

If you're a local chef, the app provides you with a platform to showcase your culinary skills and promote your meals to the community. After your licenses and certifications have been reviewed and approved, you can list your meals, manage orders, and receive feedback from your customers.

### For Customers:

As a customer, you have access to an array of meals from various local chefs. You can ask OpenAI's ChatGPT questions related to diet and nutrition, browse through meals offered by different chefs, place orders for individual meals, or even create a custom weekly meal plan according to your dietary preferences and needs.

Together, we are forging a stronger, healthier community through the shared love of food.
