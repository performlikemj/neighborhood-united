## Badge Display Logic

### All Possible Scenarios:

1. **New Chef (Just Registered)**
   - Shows: Secure Payments
   - Missing: Platform Verified (until email verified)

2. **Basic Verified Chef**
   - Shows: Platform Verified, Secure Payments
   - Missing: Background Checked, Insured

3. **Background Checked Chef**
   - Shows: Platform Verified, Background Checked, Secure Payments
   - Missing: Insured

4. **Fully Verified Chef**
   - Shows: All 4 badges
   - This is the gold standard for trust

### Recommended Badge Hierarchy:

```
Tier 1 (Free): Platform Verified + Secure Payments
Tier 2 ($): Background Checked
Tier 3 ($$): Insured & Licensed
```

## Backend Implementation Checklist

### Database Fields Needed:

```python
# In your Chef model
class Chef(models.Model):
    # Platform Verification
    is_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)  # Admin approved
    verified_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    # Background Check
    background_checked = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    background_check_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    background_check_provider = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    
    # Insurance & Licensing
    insured = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    insurance_provider = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True)
    insurance_policy_number = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    insurance_expiry = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    insurance_document = models.FileField(upload_to='chef_insurance/', null=True, blank=True)
    
    business_license = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    license_state = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    license_expiry = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    license_document = models.FileField(upload_to='chef_licenses/', null=True, blank=True)
    
    # Food Safety
    food_handlers_cert = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    food_handlers_cert_expiry = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    food_handlers_cert_document = models.FileField(upload_to='food_certs/', null=True, blank=True)
```

### API Endpoints Needed:

```python
# GET /chefs/api/public/{chef_id}/
# Returns chef with verification status

# POST /chefs/api/verification/submit-documents/
# Chef uploads insurance/license documents

# POST /admin/chefs/api/{chef_id}/verify-background/
# Admin marks background check as complete

# POST /admin/chefs/api/{chef_id}/approve-insurance/
# Admin approves insurance documentation
```

## Admin Verification Workflow

### 1. Platform Verification (Automatic)
```
✅ User registers
✅ Email verification link sent
✅ User clicks verification link
✅ is_email_verified = True
→ "Platform Verified" badge appears
```

### 2. Background Check (Manual/Service)
```
Chef submits:
- ID scan
- Social Security Number (encrypted)
- References

Admin:
- Reviews submission
- Orders background check (Checkr, etc.)
- Receives report
- Marks background_checked = True

→ "Background Checked" badge appears
```

### 3. Insurance & License (Document Review)
```
Chef uploads:
- Insurance certificate
- Business license
- Food handler's certificate

Admin:
- Verifies documents are legitimate
- Checks expiry dates
- Confirms coverage amounts
- Marks insured = True

→ "Insured & Licensed" badge appears
```

## Stripe Audit Implications

For Stripe compliance, you should:

1. ✅ **Always show "Secure Payments"** - Demonstrates PCI compliance
2. ✅ **Require "Platform Verified"** - Shows basic vetting
3. ⚠️ **Optional but recommended: Background Checked** - Higher trust
4. ⚠️ **Optional but recommended: Insurance** - Risk mitigation

**Minimum for Stripe:** Platform Verified + Secure Payments  
**Ideal for Stripe:** All 4 badges (shows serious platform)

## Testing Badge Display

### Test 1: New Unverified Chef
```javascript
const chef = {
  user: { is_email_verified: false, is_active: true }
}
// Expected: Only "Secure Payments"
```

### Test 2: Email Verified Chef
```javascript
const chef = {
  user: { is_email_verified: true, is_active: true }
}
// Expected: "Platform Verified" + "Secure Payments"
```

### Test 3: Fully Verified Chef
```javascript
const chef = {
  user: { is_email_verified: true, is_active: true },
  background_checked: true,
  insured: true
}
// Expected: All 4 badges
```

## Recommendations

1. **Implement email verification first** - Easy win for "Platform Verified"

2. **Add verification status to Chef model** - Track what's been verified

3. **Create admin verification UI** - Let admins approve/reject documents

4. **Add document upload to chef onboarding** - Streamline verification process

5. **Send expiry reminders** - Alert chefs when insurance/licenses expire

6. **Consider verification tiers:**
   - Free: Platform Verified only
   - Premium ($50/year): Add Background Check
   - Pro ($150/year): All verifications

---

## Summary

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Visual badges in place
- ✅ Conditional rendering based on data
- ✅ Responsive design
- ⚠️ Need backend fields to track verification status

**Next Steps:**
1. Add database fields for verification tracking
2. Implement email verification (if not already)
3. Create document upload flow for chefs
4. Build admin verification dashboard
5. Add expiry tracking for time-sensitive credentials

**For Stripe Audit:**
- Minimum viable: Show "Platform Verified" for email-verified chefs
- Ideal: Implement background checks for high-value bookings
