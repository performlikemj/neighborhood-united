        <h2>1) About Us and These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Sautai provides a marketplace connecting clients with independent chefs. We facilitate 
          bookings, payments, and communication but are not the food service provider. Each chef 
          operates independently and is responsible for their services.
        </p>

        <h2>2) What sautai Is (and Isn't)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>We Are:</strong> A platform to discover and book personal chef services, view menus, 
          and manage orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We Are Not:</strong> A restaurant, catering company, or food service provider. 
          We don't employ chefs or guarantee their work. Each chef is an independent contractor.
        </p>

        <h2>3) Accounts & Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming binding contracts. You're responsible 
          for maintaining account security and all activity under your account. Provide accurate 
          information and update it as needed.
        </p>

        <h2>4) Bookings, Orders, and Payments</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Bookings:</strong> When you book a service, you enter into a contract directly with 
          the chef. Prices, availability, and service details are set by each chef.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payments:</strong> Payment processing is handled through Stripe. By booking, you 
          authorize us to charge your payment method for the service amount plus any applicable fees 
          or taxes. We may hold authorization on your card until service completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Service Fees:</strong> We may charge platform fees (shown at checkout) to maintain 
          and improve our services.
        </p>

          <strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain ownership of content you post (reviews, photos, 
          messages) but grant us a license to use, display, and distribute it on the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have food allergies, medical conditions, or dietary restrictions, consult your 
          healthcare provider before booking services. Always verify ingredients and preparation 
          methods with your chef. We are not liable for allergic reactions, food-related illnesses, 
          or health issues arising from chef-prepared meals.

        <p>
          <strong>Chef Services:</strong> We don't warrant the quality, safety, or legality of chef

          in question, or $100, whichever is less.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
