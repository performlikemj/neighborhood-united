          We want every experience with sautai to be great. Because services reserve a chef's time 
          and perishable ingredients depend on timing and status: This Policy applies to all bookings 
          and meal orders made through the platform.

            </div>
            <p>
              We understand plans change. Cancel between 24-48 hours before your service for a 50% refund. 
              The chef retains 50% to cover prep time and purchased ingredients.

            <p>
              Cancellations within 24 hours of service, no-shows, or failure to provide kitchen access 
              forfeit the full payment. Chef has already prepared and purchased ingredients.

        <h3>Service Issues</h3>
        <p>
          If there's a problem with your chef service (chef doesn't show up, quality issues, safety 
          concerns), contact <strong>support@sautai.com</strong> within 24 hours of the scheduled 
          service time. We'll work with you and the chef to resolve the issue, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full or partial refund</li>
          <li>Service credit for future booking</li>
          <li>Rescheduling with the same or different chef</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Refund requests made more than 24 hours after the service time 
          cannot be guaranteed and will be reviewed case-by-case.
        </p>

        <h3>Cancellation by Chef</h3>
        <p>
          If a chef cancels your confirmed booking, you'll receive an immediate full refund and a 
          $25 service credit toward your next booking (if available within 30 days). We'll also help 
          you find an alternative chef if possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Meal Orders (delivery)</h2>

        <h3>Cancellation Before Prep Begins</h3>
        <div className="refund-tier">
          <div className="refund-tier-header">
            <strong>Before prep begins</strong>
            <span className="refund-badge full">Full Refund</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Cancel your meal order before the chef begins preparation for a complete refund. 
            Order cutoff times are displayed on each meal event listing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>After Prep Begins / Delivery Day</h3>
        <div className="refund-tier">
          <div className="refund-tier-header">
            <strong>After prep begins / delivery day</strong>
            <span className="refund-badge none">No Refund</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Once a chef starts preparing your meal or on the day of delivery, the order cannot be 
            refunded. Perishable food has been purchased and prepared specifically for you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Meal Quality Issues</h3>
        <p>
          If you receive a meal with quality issues (wrong items, spoiled/unsafe food, doesn't match 
          description), contact support@sautai.com immediately with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Photos of the meal</li>
          <li>Description of the issue</li>
          <li>Your order number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We'll review your case and may provide a full/partial refund, replacement meal, or service 
          credit. Claims must be submitted within 24 hours of delivery/pickup.
        </p>

        <h2>Dietary Restrictions & Allergies</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Critical:</strong> You are responsible for clearly communicating all allergies and 
          dietary restrictions when booking. If you don't disclose allergies and a meal contains that 
          allergen, you are not eligible for a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you properly disclosed allergies and the meal still contains restricted ingredients, 
          contact support immediately for a full refund. Your safety is our priority.
        </p>

        <h2>Recurring Services</h2>
        <p>
          For recurring/subscription services, you can cancel anytime. Cancellation takes effect 
          after your current billing period ends. No refunds for partial billing periods unless 
          there's a service issue.
        </p>

        <h2>Weather & Emergencies</h2>
        <p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chef cancels:</strong> Full refund</li>
          <li><strong>Client cancels:</strong> Full refund if cancellation occurs before chef has purchased ingredients (typically 24-48 hours before)</li>
